--- Floors ---

Floor rating is used to determine which heroes can show up
and what level range they have (ie. Rookies can start to
appear at 50 rating or so). Values and formulas are
tentative.

- Rating
0:    - Newbs         (1    to     2)   100%

30:   - Newbs         (2    to     6)   100%

100:  - Newbs         (4    to    10)    75%
      - Rookies       (1    to     3)    25%

150:  - Newbs         (6    to    17)    50%
      - Rookies       (2    to     6)    40%
      - Adventurers   (1    to     3)    10%
